Cardiotocography (CTG) Dataset Classification using Multilayer Perceptrons in Keras (R)


Overview


This repository contains R code for building and training multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks using the Keras package to perform multiclass classification on the Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset. The CTG dataset is used to predict fetal state during pregnancy.
